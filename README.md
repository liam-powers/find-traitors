# find-traitors
Short Python script to find who's not following you back on Instagram. I do not claim liability for any emotional peril caused.

Setup:
- Requires python3 and pip3.
- If you haven't installed instaloader yet, run "pip3 install instaloader" on your command line.
- Run the program with "python3 find_traitors.py"
- Enter your login information and follow the prompts. Obtaining your followers/followees list does take a minute or two.
